Today's release of ql.io 0.5 includes the following changes:

<!-- more -->

* Enable caching on ql.io response. You can add `using headers` clause to routes to add arbitrary
  response headers, as in
  `return 'hello' via route '/hello' using method get using headers 'Cache-Control' = 'max-age=3600';`
* [Experimental] Enable caching of responses from APIs for select statements. `create table`
  statements can now include an `expires <interval>` clause to specify an interval for caching
  responses of `select` statements, as in `create table auto.compute.key on select get from 'http://a.uri.net' ... expires 10;`
* Process gzip/deflate encoded responses from upstream servers.
* Support `Content-Encoding` for incoming requests and gzip/deflate encode responses.
* Several bug fixes to maintain hierarchical logging of script execution. You can handle events
  emitted by the engine to log script execution flow. Watch this blog for an example soon.
* Factor out cluster management to a new module [cluster2](https://github.com/ql-io/cluster2) to
  support deployments on [CloudFoundry](https://github.com/ql-io/ql.io-cloudfoundry) and
  [Heroku](https://github.com/mulder/ql.io-heroku).
* New URI `/api` to navigate tables and routes - see
  [En Route](http://ql-io.github.com/2012/03/12/en-route.html) for details.
* Support `delete` statements.
* Upgrade CodeMirror to 2.22 to resolve some quirks in the console UI.
* Add a page to show all installed npm packages. Try http://<host>:<monport>/deps
  (or http://localhost:3001/deps).
* Support custom xml2json convertors to enable clients interop with legacy XML APIs.
* Recover shutdown/stop from extraneous pid files.
* Simplify response decoding. In stead of setting encoding on the response, collect buffers into
  array, and then decode in the default impl of 'parse response'.
* Removed /in-flight requests api.
* Enable numbers in `in` clause and args of udfs
* Export version from each module. You can find version of a module using
  `require('ql.io-<somemodule>').version`.
* Include version number in `User-Agent` and `Server` headers.
* Support scatter-gather for requests with bodies by adding a `foreach 'param'` for the
  `using bodyTemplate` cluase. This allows scripts to batchup POST and PUT requests.
* Support ejs body templates.
* Skip files that don't end with `.ql`.
* "/ecv" check returns network ip instead of loopback address
* Let the engine allow a monkey patch to parse the response. Useful to process binary formats like avro.
