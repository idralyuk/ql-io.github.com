cluster2 is a node.js (>= 0.6.x) compatible multi-process management module. This module grew out of
our needs in operationalizing node.js for [ql.io](https://github.com/ql-io/ql.io) at eBay. Built on
node's `cluster`, cluster2 adds several safeguards and utility functions to help support real-world
production scenarios:

* Scriptable start, shutdown and stop flows
* Worker monitoring for process deaths
* Worker recycling
* Graceful shutdown
* Idle timeouts
* Validation hooks (for other tools to monitor cluster2 apps)
* Events for logging cluster activities

See [http://ql-io.github.com/cluster2/](cluster2) for more info.
